Ok - so this isn't Sitecore related, but I just 'happened' upon a cool feature in Windows that I'm sure everyone knows about already, but I thought it cool enough to post about it :)

If you want to open up a **Powershell** window at the location that **Windows Explorer** is at, you can just type **Powershell** in the address bar and hey presto, Powershell opens up already set to the folder location.

Just like this:


{% asset_image "capture.gif" %}

Enjoy
