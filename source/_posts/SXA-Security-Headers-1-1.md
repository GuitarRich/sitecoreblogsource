I am pleased to announce the latest version of [SXA Security Headers](https://github.com/GuitarRich/SXA.SecurityHeaders). This version contains the same functionality, but has been built and tested against the latest versions of Sitecore. Currently it supports all versions of Sitecore from v9-9.1.1 and SXA 1.7.0-1.8.1.

I have also fixed an issue with the folders in the Sitecore Package where some of the enumerations were being stored in the wrong place.

My access to the market place is messed up right now due to an email change, but as soon as I get it back, I'll upload the latest packages there. For now you can download the latest from the [github releases page](https://github.com/GuitarRich/SXA.SecurityHeaders/releases). 

There are 3 packages, a full package with items and binaries, I have also included an "Items Only" package for easy installation if you want to fork the code and use that direct in your solution. Finally, there is a binaries only package for ease of deployment on CD instances.

I would love to hear any suggestions on how this module can be improved or new features added, or just how you are using it in your project.
